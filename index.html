                    <p class="lead text-lg">This report details the rapid two-week development sprint that took the WMSU CMS from a simple prototype to a feature-rich, responsive, and accessible platform. Below is a week-by-week summary of the key achievements.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Week 1: Project Foundation & Core Features (June 2 - June 6)</h2>
                    <p>The project kicked off with the initialization of the WMSU CMS, laying down essential pages and the authentication system. Early efforts focused on establishing the admin interface, improving mobile navigation, and setting up category archives. The codebase underwent several refactors to enhance readability and maintainability. By midweek, the sidebar became more responsive, and the logout process was streamlined using JavaScript. The project also introduced a comprehensive README and began integrating CKEditor for content input, refining file upload handling, and improving title display.</p>
                    <p>Towards the end of the week, the team focused on settings management, footer and header integration, and the introduction of maintenance mode. Database schemas and seed data were added, with special attention to appearance customization and user management. The UI saw improvements in card layouts, text overflow handling, and password reset functionality. The groundwork for menu helpers and mobile menu enhancements was also laid.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Week 2: UI Refinement, Hierarchies, and Dynamic Content (June 7 - June 13)</h2>
                    <p>The second week was marked by a push towards dynamic navigation and hierarchical management. Dropdown menus became dynamic, supporting nested submenus and improved mobile experiences. The page and menu management systems were enhanced to support parent-child relationships, making the CMS more flexible for complex content structures.</p>
                    <p>Visual polish continued with refined dropdown styling, hover effects, and responsive adjustments. The events section was refactored for better layout, and the admin panel received a scrollable sidebar. The Board of Regents management page was implemented, and new fields such as descriptions were added to support richer content. The Quick Links section was introduced, allowing dynamic links to be managed from settings. The codebase continued to be refactored for clarity, and redundant sections were removed.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Week 3: Feature Expansion & Accessibility (June 14)</h2>
                    <p>In the final stretch, the CMS saw the addition of a featured content system, including a new <code>is_featured</code> column for posts and an auto-archiving feature for excess posts. The home page received accessibility improvements, and default value handling for footer and header settings was streamlined. Quick links rendering was enhanced to support image URLs, and further instructions were added for clarity.</p>
                    
                    <hr>
                    
                    <p><strong>Overall</strong>, these two weeks transformed the WMSU CMS from a basic framework into a robust platform with powerful admin tools, dynamic navigation, and a strong focus on maintainability and user experience.</p>
